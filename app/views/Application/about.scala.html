      <h1>A simple tool for cataloguing recipes.</h1>
      <section>
        <h3>The process of collecting and storing recipes hasn't kept up with how people interact with information these days.</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, people keep recipes in a paper filing system. More tech-savvy folks might write them in text files. These solutions are effective for <em>storing</em> the recipes, but break down when you want to share what you're been cooking.</p>
        <p><strong>Instead of handwriting someone a recipe on an index card or transcribing it into an email, the goal of Gingrsnap is to make recipes linkable.</strong</p>

        <h3>Aggregation and discovery is a solved problem.</h3>
        <p>The internet is already a great place to look for ideas on things to cook. There are numerous websites and apps that list recipes from professional cooks and food bloggers. However, if you're someone who likes to fiddle with recipes or come up with new culinary creations, the current set of applications don't suit your needs.</p>
        <p><strong>Gingrsnap is the recipe-collecting tool that creative cooks need.</strong> Now you don't have to be a dedicated food blogger to have a simple outlet for your cooking.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Bring recipe-collecting into the 21st century.</h3>
        <p>The next time you cook for friends or family members and someone requests the recipe for the delicious baked salmon you prepared or the pumpkin bread you baked, send them a link to your recipe on Gingrsnap.</p>

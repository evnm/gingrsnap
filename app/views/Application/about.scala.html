      <h3>Bring your recipe collection into the 21st century.</h3>
      <p>The process of collecting and storing recipes hasn't kept up with how people interact with information. The Internet was built decades ago to make it easy to publish and share textual documents, and yet recipes have never made the leap.</p>
      <p><strong>This is where Gingrsnap comes in.</strong> Instead of photocopying a recipe or typing it up in an email, send your friends and family links to your recipes on Gingrsnap.</p>
